# AplCore
This is a project to create an application tracking application. It's currently under development built with:
- Rust as a backend
- React as a frontend
- MongoDB as the database

  
Although only proposed to have application tracking as the main feature, there can be other professional and job searching features like:
- Community creation and interaction
- Chatting between users
- Resume Recommendations with AI

This is a project that can grow pretty quickly and I hope to keep adding updates rapidly to see how it performs in production

# Other Tools Used
- Jetbrains Space for project planning and update blogs
